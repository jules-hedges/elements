C monoidal closed category
hom (A (x) B, C) = hom (A, B -o C)

Linear lens (x, x') -> (y, y')
= x -> (y' -o x') (x) y


The following are equivalent:
- "closed actegories" = action with a right adjoint
- "tensored/copowered enriched categories"

M monoidal category
C category enriched in M, hom(-, -) : C^op x C -> M
M acts on C : . : M x C -> C
hom_C (X . Y, Z) = hom_M (X, hom_C (Y, Z))
(X : M, Y : C, Z : C)

x, y, x', y' : C
x -> hom_C (y', x') . y
(morphism in C)

M monoidal category
C cateogry, M acts on C
D category, D enriched in M
x, y : C
x', y' : D
x -> hom_D (y', x') . y
(morphism in C)

******

M monoidal category
M acts on C
D enriched in M
A [what] D -> C is a monoidal category M, an enrichment of D in M and an action of M on C

D^op x D -> M
M x C -> C
D^op x D -> M -> [C, C]
