A cartesian link \\binom{f'}{f} : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Y'}{Y} in {\\mathcal{C}} is a pair of morphisms f : X \\to Y and f : X \\times X' \\to Y'. Example 2.1 Let f : \\mathbb R^m \\to \\mathbb R^n be a smooth function between Euclidean spaces. There is a cartesian link D (f) : \\binom{\\mathbb R^m}{\\mathbb R^m} \\to \\binom{\\mathbb R^n}{\\mathbb R^n} in the category \\mathbf{Euc} of Euclidean spaces and smooth functions, called the forward derivative link of f, given by The [what] is f : \\mathbb R^m \\to \\mathbb R^n The [what] is f' : \\mathbb R^m \\times \\mathbb R^m \\to \\mathbb R^n given by f' (x, v) = v \\cdot J_f (x), where J_f (x) is the Jacaobian of f evaluated at x, and \\cdot is multiplication of that matrix by the vector v. Proposition 2.1 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a cartesian closed category. Then a colink \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Y'}{Y} can be equivalently seen as a morphism X \\to Y \\times [X', Y'] in {\\mathcal{C}}. Definition 2.2 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and let \\binom{f'}{f} : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Y'}{Y} and \\binom{g'}{g} : \\binom{Y'}{Y} \\to \\binom{Z'}{Z} be cartesian links in {\\mathcal{C}}. The composition of links is given by \\binom{f'}{f} \\binom{g'}{g} : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Z'}{Z} where The [what] is f g : X \\to Z The [what] is (f g)' : X \\times X' \\to Z' given by [todo diagram] Proposition 2.2 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and let f : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Y'}{Y}, g : \\binom{Y'}{Y} \\to \\binom{Z'}{Z} and h : \\binom{Z'}{Z} \\to \\binom{W'}{W} be cartesian links in {\\mathcal{C}}. Then (\\binom{f'}{f} \\binom{g'}{g}) \\binom{h'}{h} = \\binom{f'}{f} (\\binom{g'}{g} \\binom{h'}{h}). Definition 2.3 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and let X, X' be objects of {\\mathcal{C}}. The identity cartesian link 1_{\\binom{X'}{X}} : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{X'}{X} is given by The [what] is the identity morphism 1_X : X \\to X The [what] is the projection \\pi_2 : X \\times X' \\to X' Proposition 2.3 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and let f : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Y'}{Y} be a cartesian link in {\\mathcal{C}}. Then 1_{\\binom{X'}{X}} f = f = f 1_{\\binom{Y'}{Y}}. Definition 2.4 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products. Then \\overrightarrow{\\mathscr L}({\\mathcal{C}}) is the category whose objects are pairs of objects of {\\mathcal{C}}, and whose morphisms are cartesian links in {\\mathcal{C}}. 2.2 The category of cartesian colinks Definition 2.5 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and let X, X', Y, Y' be objects of {\\mathcal{C}}. A cartesian colink \\binom{f'}{f} : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Y'}{Y} in {\\mathcal{C}} is a pair of morphisms f : X \\to Y and f' : X \\times Y' \\to X'. f is called the forwards pass and f' is called the backwards pass. Example 2.2 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and let X, Y be objects of {\\mathcal{C}}. There is a cartesian colink \\pi_1 : \\binom{X \\times Y}{X \\times Y} \\to \\binom{X}{X}, also known as a lens X \\to Y, given by: The forwards pass is the projection \\pi_1 : X \\times Y \\to X The backwards pass is \\pi_1' : (X \\times Y) \\times X \\to X \\times Y given by \\pi_1' ((x, y), x') = (x', y) [TODO - write with string diagram] Similarly there is a cartesian colink \\pi_2 : \\binom{X \\times Y}{X \\times Y} \\to \\binom{Y}{Y}. Example 2.3 Let f : \\mathbb R^m \\to \\mathbb R^n be a smooth function between Euclidean spaces. There is a cartesian colink D (f) : \\binom{\\mathbb R^m}{\\mathbb R^m} \\to \\binom{\\mathbb R^n}{\\mathbb R^n} in the category \\mathbf{Euc} of Euclidean spaces and smooth functions, called the reverse derivative colink of f, given by The forwards pass is f : \\mathbb R^m \\to \\mathbb R^n The backrwards pass is f' : \\mathbb R^m \\times \\mathbb R^n \\to \\mathbb R^n given by f' (x, v) = J_f (x)^\\top \\cdot v, where J_f (x)^\\top is the transpose Jacobian of f evaluated at x, and \\cdot is multiplication of that matrix by the vector v. Proposition 2.4 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a cartesian closed category. Then a colink \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Y'}{Y} in {\\mathcal{C}} can be equivalently seen as a morphism X \\to Y \\times [Y', X'] in {\\mathcal{C}}. Definition 2.6 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and let \\binom{f'}{f} : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Y'}{Y} and \\binom{g'}{g} : \\binom{Y'}{Y} \\to \\binom{Z'}{Z} be cartesian colinks in {\\mathcal{C}}. The composition of the colinks is given by \\binom{f'}{f} \\binom{g'}{g} : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Z'}{Z} where The forwards pass is f g : X \\to Z The backwards pass is (f g)' : X \\times Z' \\to X' defined in the internal language of {\\mathcal{C}} by (f g)' (x, z) = f' (x, g' (f (x), z)) [TODO - write this definition in string diagrams instead] Proposition 2.5 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and let \\binom{f'}{f} : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Y'}{Y}, \\binom{g'}{g} : \\binom{Y'}{Y} \\to \\binom{Z'}{Z} and \\binom{h'}{h} : \\binom{Z'}{Z} \\to \\binom{W'}{W} be cartesian colinks in {\\mathcal{C}}. Then (\\binom{f'}{f} \\binom{g'}{g}) \\binom{h'}{h} = \\binom{f'}{f} (\\binom{g'}{g} \\binom{h'}{h}). Definition 2.7 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and let X, X' be objects of {\\mathcal{C}}. The identity cartesian colink 1_{\\binom{X'}{X}} : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{X'}{X} is given by The forwards pass is the identity morphism 1_X : X \\to X The backwwards pass is the projection \\pi_2 : X \\times X' \\to X' Proposition 2.6 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and let f : \\binom{X'}{X} \\to \\binom{Y'}{Y} be a cartesian colink in {\\mathcal{C}}. Then 1_{\\binom{X'}{X}} f = f = f 1_{\\binom{Y'}{Y}}. Definition 2.8 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products. Then \\overleftarrow{\\mathscr L}({\\mathcal{C}}) is the category whose objects are pairs of objects of {\\mathcal{C}}, and whose morphisms are cartesian colinks in {\\mathcal{C}}. Proposition 2.7 There is a functor D : \\mathbf{Euc} \\to \\overleftarrow{\\mathscr L}(\\mathbf{Euc}) given on objects by D (X) = \\binom{X}{X} and on morphisms by D (f) from example ??. 2.3 Basic constructions for cartesian links and colinks Proposition 2.8 let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products. Then there is a functor \\binom{-}{-} : {\\mathcal{C}} \\times {\\mathcal{C}} \\to \\overrightarrow{\\mathscr L}({\\mathcal{C}}) given by: On objects: (X, X') \\mapsto \\binom{X'}{X} On morphisms: (f, g) \\mapsto \\binom{\\pi_2 g}{f} Proposition 2.9 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products.

Then there is a functor \\mathbb K: \\overleftarrow{\\mathscr L}({\\mathcal{C}})^\\mathrm{op}\\to {\\mathcal{C}}, called the closed continuation functor, given by: On objects, \\mathbb K\\binom{X'}{X} = [X, X'] On morphisms [TODO] [TODO - talk about the ambiguous notation for \\mathbb K, it could be made precise using enrichment but I don’t consider it worth it] Proposition 2.15 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products. Let \\left&lt; \\mathbb E, \\mathbb L \\right&gt; : \\overrightarrow{\\mathscr L}({\\mathcal{C}}) \\to {\\mathcal{C}} \\times {\\mathcal{C}} be the functor given by \\binom{X'}{X} \\mapsto (X, X \\times X'). Then there is an adjunction \\left&lt; \\mathbb E, \\mathbb L \\right&gt; \\dashv \\binom{-}{-}. Proposition 2.16 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a cartesian closed category.

Proposition 2.18 Let {\\mathcal{C}} with a category with finite products whose terminal object is 1. Then \\binom{1}{1} is terminal in \\overrightarrow{\\mathscr L}({\\mathcal{C}}). Proposition 2.19 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite (all) products and finite (all) distributive coproducts.

Proposition 2.20 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, with an initial object 0 and a terminal object 1. Then \\binom{0}{1} is terminal in \\overleftarrow{\\mathscr L}({\\mathcal{C}}). Proposition 2.21 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products and finite (all) distributive coproducts.

Proposition 2.22 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products and an initial object 0. Then for any object X of {\\mathcal{C}}, \\binom{X}{0} is initial in \\overleftarrow{\\mathscr L}({\\mathcal{C}}). Example 2.4 The category \\overleftarrow{\\mathscr L}(\\mathbf{Set}) does not have all coproducts, but it does have some coproducts that are not of the form of proposition [todo fix ref]. [todo example of a missing coproduct] An example of a coproduct present in \\overleftarrow{\\mathscr L}(\\mathbf{Set}) not of the form of [todo ref] is \\binom{0}{1} + \\binom{1}{1} = \\binom{0}{2} 2.5 Fibrational structure of cartesian links and colinks Proposition 2.23 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and X an object of {\\mathcal{C}}.

[TODO cite Lambek + Scott] Proposition 2.25 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products, and f : X \\to Y a morphism of {\\mathcal{C}}.

We say that a square of the form [todo] where h_1 and h_2 are colinks in {\\mathcal{C}} and v_1 and v_2 are links in {\\mathcal{C}} formally commutes if: [todo condition 1] [todo condition 2] Definition 2.10 Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category with finite products. Then {\\mathcal{L}} ({\\mathcal{C}}) is the double category where: Objects are pairs of objects of {\\mathcal{C}} Loose 1-cells are cartesian colinks in {\\mathcal{C}} Tight 1-cells are cartesian links in {\\mathcal{C}} There is a unique 2-cell [write] when the square formally commutes. 2.7 Notes Links first appeared to my knowledge as morphisms in the total category of Bart Jacobs’ simple fibration [Jacobs, Categorical logic and type theory] Their central role in categorical systems theory was recognised by David Jaz Myers [Myers, Categorical systems theory] Colinks have a much more complicated history [todo] Wiring diagrams operad?
